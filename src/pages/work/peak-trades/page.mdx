    'Peak Trades is a family-run electrical and heating business operating across Greater Manchester, Cheshire, and parts of Yorkshire. They were relying entirely on word of mouth and Checkatrade — and their pipeline was unpredictable.',

    'Peak Trades came to us with no organic search presence and complete dependence on paid referral platforms that were costing them hundreds of pounds a month in subscription fees.',
    'After six months of AI-powered local SEO and content, they now rank on the first page for every core service across their coverage area — and their diary is consistently full without paying a penny in referral fees.',

## The challenge

Trades businesses have a particular problem with online visibility: they operate locally, often across multiple towns and service areas, and the keyword landscape is fragmented — "electrician Manchester," "boiler repair Stockport," "emergency plumber Altrincham" are all different searches requiring different content.

Peak Trades had a basic website with a contact form and a list of services. They had no blog, no location pages, and no optimised content. Their Google Business Profile was unclaimed. They were spending £400 a month on Checkatrade and Rated People and getting inconsistent results.

The goal was to eliminate their dependence on referral platforms by building genuine organic presence across their service area.

## What we did

We mapped out all 47 service-location combinations that were relevant to Peak Trades' coverage area — every combination of their services (electrical installation, fault finding, boiler servicing, heating installation) and every town in their geography.

Our AI system then produced dedicated location pages for each combination, each written with genuine specificity about the local area and the specific service. We also produced a series of helpful articles targeting common homeowner questions — "how much does a consumer unit upgrade cost," "signs your boiler needs servicing" — that drive high-intent traffic.

Google Business Profile was optimised and a systematic review generation process was put in place, bringing their rating from 3.2 to 4.8 over six months.
