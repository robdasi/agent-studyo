## The challenge

Bloom & Co is a success story that nearly became a cautionary tale. They'd built a beautiful brand on Instagram, grown to 45,000 followers, and scaled to £1.2M in annual revenue — almost all of it driven by a combination of organic social content and Meta advertising.

Then two things happened. Meta's algorithm deprioritised organic content from brand accounts in favour of Reels and paid content. And their ad costs, which had been around £0.30 CPC, more than tripled as competition increased.

Their revenue dropped 30% in four months. They needed a new acquisition channel that didn't depend on a platform's algorithm or ad auction.

## What we did

We started with a keyword strategy built around the specific things Bloom & Co's customers were searching for: particular styles of homeware ("japandi vases UK," "sustainable candles"), gift occasions ("housewarming gifts for her," "ethical Christmas gifts"), and interior design inspiration ("how to style a bedroom with neutral tones").

Our AI content system produced a systematic programme of blog content targeting these keywords — genuinely useful articles with specific product recommendations from the Bloom & Co range, naturally optimised for the search terms their ideal customers were using.

We also overhauled their product page content, introducing proper keyword targeting and schema markup that had been entirely absent. Collections pages were restructured to rank for category terms.

Within three months, the first pieces of content were driving meaningful traffic. By month six, organic had become their second-largest acquisition channel. By month eight, it was their largest.
