## The challenge

Family law is one of the most competitive categories in local search. Every solicitor in South London is targeting the same terms — "family solicitor South London," "divorce lawyer Croydon," "child custody solicitor" — and most have been building their SEO presence for years.

Southfield had a good reputation locally but a weak digital footprint. Their site was five years old, rarely updated, and contained mostly generic copy that said nothing distinctive about the practice.

Two previous agencies had attempted to improve their rankings. Both had produced some content and made minor technical changes. Neither had produced meaningful results.

## What we did

We started with a comprehensive audit of Southfield's current search presence, their competitors' strategies, and the keyword landscape in their market.

The audit revealed two primary issues: a severe lack of content depth on core practice areas, and a missed opportunity in long-tail keywords around specific circumstances — "what to do if my spouse won't agree to a divorce," "how does child custody work in the UK" — that their target clients were actually searching for.

We deployed a custom AI content system that began producing detailed, genuinely useful articles targeting these long-tail queries. The content was structured to demonstrate expertise, reviewed by the partners for accuracy, and optimised for the specific search signals that were driving rankings in their market.

In parallel, we overhauled their Google Business Profile — optimising their service descriptions, gathering and responding to reviews, and building local citations across relevant directories.
